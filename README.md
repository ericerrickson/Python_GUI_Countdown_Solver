# Python_GUI_Countdown_Solver
"Countdown" is a UK game show, part of which is a numbers game. The rules are simple: the players choose six numbers at random from two piles -- one the numbers one through ten, and the other with only the numbers twenty five, fifty, seventy five, and one hundred. A three digit target number is randomly produced and the players must attempt to get to that target number using the numbers they chose and the * ? + - operators. This app brute forces that process and returns every possible correct answer. Testing.
